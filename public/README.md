# Decoo Restaurant

A simple, responsive restaurant landing page for Decoo Restaurant.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure and content.
- CSS3 for layout, typography, and styling.
- JavaScript for small interactive behaviors (modal and menu interactions).
- Google Fonts for typography.

## How This Was Created (with Codex)
This page was built as a static website and iterated with help from Codex inside the project workspace. Codex assisted with:
- Styling and typography improvements (including the hero headline and brand sizing).
- Layout tweaks and responsive adjustments.
- Content edits like footer updates and removing sections.

All changes were made directly in the project files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`) and can be reviewed in the commit history or file diffs.
